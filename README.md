This is the code for the task no 02
here the question is to create a k-means clustering algorithm on a given dataset based on the customer's previous history.
1st i've collected the dataset and read the data in the csv file, and then I've imported the necessary libraries from the sci-kit learn and gave a code to ignore all the warnings.
later on, I checked the basic structure of the data and displayed the statistical summary of the data.
using data visualisation i created countplots and histplots of every variable to understand the pattern and relationship of the varaibles
and then i checked the if any variables are correlated to each other using a heatmap.
then using k-means clustering algorithms i segmented the data based on their income, purchase and spendings.
using predective modelling i predicteed the spending score based on the given features.
and at last i checked the accuracy of my model.
that is how ive done my task 02.
